About me
=========
This is Amir Yazdani.  I received BSc from Tehran Polytecnic (2018) and MSc from University of Arizona (2022). I have interned with ED2 Corp., Tucson, AZ, and DOCOMO Innovations Inc., Palo Alto, CA. 

You can access my research works in [Publications](https://amirhya.github.io/amir.github.io//publications/) tab.


**Wireless Communication Experience**: Developped MAC protocol-adaptation frameworks and algorithms to achieve fairness in Wi-Fi/LTE-LAA/5G NR-U WLANs. Designed and developped of Discrete event simulator  IEEE 802.11 ac and 5G mmWave systems.

**Machine Learning Experience:** Developped and designed conventional ML (random forests), CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, transformers, AutoML, HyperOpt and RL algorithms. 

**Signal Processing** Designed cross-correlation based detection of uplink collisions in CSMA/CA systems. 


**RF Hardware:**: Developped Software Defined Radios (SDR), Ettus an National intruments. Measurements with RF and spectrum analyzers. 

**Software Skills:** Python, MATLAB, C/C++, ns-3, LabVIEW, Unix Shell
