excerpt: '(PHY layer authenticatio, CSI based localization, CNN, Intel 5300i NIC)This paper is about physical layer authentication using UL estimated CSI. A double-branch CNN architecture is designed topredict whether its two CSI inputs are from the sasme location or not. Devices are authenticated if their received CSI matches a set of already authenticated locations. In a sense, the authentication system localizes devices based on their estimated CSI and then uses localization information for lozalization.
In this work we evaluate our localization/authentication perrformance via real world data using comodity Intel 5300i NICs.'
