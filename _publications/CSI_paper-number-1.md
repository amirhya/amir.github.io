This paper is about physical layer authentication using Wi-Fi channel estimates. A double-branch CNN architecture is designed to predict whether its two CSI inputs are from the sasme location or not. Devices are authenticated if their received CSI matches a set of already authenticated locations. In a sense, the authentication system localizes devices based on their estimated CSI and then uses localization information for authentication.
This work evaluates localization/authentication performance via using world Wi-Fi data using comodity Intel 5300i NICs.
